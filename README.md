Sicepu: Campus Facility Reporting System
Sicepu (System Informasi Pelaporan Kerusakan Fasilitas Kampus) is a dedicated web-based application designed to streamline the process of reporting malfunctioning or broken lecture equipment and campus facilities. This system empowers college students to easily report issues, ensuring timely maintenance and an improved learning environment.

üåü Features
Student Reporting: Intuitive interface for students to submit reports on damaged equipment or facilities.

Detailed Reporting: Users can provide details such as location, type of equipment, description of the issue, and optionally attach images.

Report Tracking: Students can track the status of their submitted reports (e.g., pending, in progress, resolved).

Admin Dashboard: (Planned/Future Feature) A dedicated dashboard for facility management staff to view, manage, and update report statuses.

Notification System: (Planned/Future Feature) Automated notifications for status updates on reports.

User Authentication: Secure login for students and administrators.

üéØ Purpose
The primary goal of Sicepu is to bridge the communication gap between students and campus facility management. By providing an efficient and transparent reporting mechanism, Sicepu aims to:

Accelerate the repair and maintenance process of campus facilities.

Enhance the overall quality of the learning environment.

Foster a proactive approach to campus upkeep.

Increase student satisfaction by addressing their concerns promptly.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
While the specific technologies are not yet defined, a typical stack for such an application might include:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap), JavaScript (e.g., React, Vue, Angular)

Backend: Node.js (Express), Python (Django, Flask), PHP (Laravel), Ruby on Rails

Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase Firestore

Deployment: Docker, Heroku, Vercel, Netlify

(Note: The actual technologies will be updated once the development stack is finalized.)

üöÄ Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (if using a JavaScript-based backend/frontend framework)

npm or yarn

Git

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sicepu.git
cd sicepu

Install dependencies (Frontend example):

cd frontend
npm install
# or yarn install

Install dependencies (Backend example):

cd backend
npm install
# or pip install -r requirements.txt (for Python)

Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the backend directory and add necessary environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys).

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=sicepu_db

Run database migrations (if applicable):

# Example for Node.js with Sequelize
npx sequelize db:migrate

Start the development servers:

# Start backend
cd backend
npm start
# or python app.py
```bash
# Start frontend
cd frontend
npm start
# or yarn start

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or the port configured for your frontend).

üí° Usage
Once the application is running:

Register/Login: Students can register for an account or log in if they already have one.
